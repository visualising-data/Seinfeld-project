		Letâ€™s go back to the start. Seinfeld aired on US TV for the first time on Wednesday 5th July
		1989, with a pilot episode titled <span class="em">Good News, Bad News</span> (it was also known
		as The Seinfeld Chronicles, the inspiration for the title of this project).

		Though it was watched by 15.4M viewers, the early reviews were mixed - test audiences hated, TV
		critics liked it - so its future was initially uncertain. However, thanks to the perseverance
		and persuasion of NBC executive Rick Ludwin, four more episodes were belatedly ordered to
		complete the unusually short first season.

		This opening season belatedly wrapped a year later, in the summer of 1990, and was received with
		healthy ratings from critics and audiences alike. This response was positive enough to convince
		NBC to commission a second season, this time comprising 12 episodes.

		Despite a slightly rocky start with Season Two, critical reviews and audience ratings continued
		to improve giving NBC reason to not only green-light a third season but to move the show into
		the sought-after Fall schedule, where buzz, anticipation, and advertising revenues peak.

		Towards the middle of Season Four the show was moved to Thursdays, straight after Cheers, in the
		most popular prime-time slot. When the final episode was broadcast, on 14th May 1998, it brought
		to an end <span class="em">nine seasons</span> and a total of
		<span class="em">176 episodes</span> (plus four specials).
